                        sure
                        therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
                        modify
                        the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                        extract
                        the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other
                        languages, or
                        make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights
                        and
                        other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Teneocto Technologies Co.,
                        LTD.</p>

                    <p>Teneocto Technologies Co., LTD. is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient
                        as
                        possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
                        services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
                        without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

                    <p>The TeneConnect app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to
                        provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
                        We
                        therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                        removing
                        software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
                        It
                        could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                        security features and it could mean that the TeneConnect app won’t work properly or at all.</p>

                    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Teneocto Technologies Co., LTD. will not
                        take
                        responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
                        connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but
                        Teneocto
                        Technologies Co., LTD. cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality
                        if
                        you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

                    <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                        agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                        your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                        app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any
                        such
                        charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
                        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
                        device on
                        which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
                        from
                        the bill payer for using the app.</p>

                    <p>Along the same lines, Teneocto Technologies Co., LTD. cannot always take responsibility for the
                        way
                        you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Teneocto Technologies Co., LTD. cannot
                        accept
                        responsibility.</p>

                    <p>With respect to Teneocto Technologies Co., LTD.’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
                        you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that
                        it is
                        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so
                        that
                        we can make it available to you. Teneocto Technologies Co., LTD. accepts no liability for any
                        loss,
                        direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the
                        app.</p>

                    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS –
                        the
                        requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
                        availability
                        of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
                        app. Teneocto Technologies Co., LTD. does not promise that it will always update the app so that
                        it
                        is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your
                        device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
                        may
                        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
                        notice
                        of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
                        licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
                        needed)
                        delete it from your device.</p>
